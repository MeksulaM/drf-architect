# **DRF Architect**

## **About**

`drf-architect.py` is a script written in Python, that automates Django REST Framework project start-up.

When run, script does the following tasks:

1. Creates python's virtual environment
2. Installs necessary packages
3. Creates `requirements.txt` file
4. Starts new Django project

Currently, script works only on Windows OS.

`drf-architect.py` allows users to customize several default settings, as they are described in<br>
[**Usage**](#usage) section.

## **Prerequisites**

-   Python 3

I recommend using currently supported versions (3.7 and above).  
Versions below 3.6 will not work because script contains f-strings.

## **Usage**
